## Wages and Pay Regulations

Maryland’s wage laws ensure fair compensation, with specific rules for minimum wages, tipped employees, and pay transparency:

- ~ Minimum Wage: The state minimum wage is $15.00 per hour (effective January 1, 2024). Some counties have higher rates: Montgomery County ($15.50–$17.65, depending on employer size, as of July 1, 2025), Howard County ($16.00 for 15+ employees, January 1, 2025), and Prince George’s County ($17.10 until June 30, 2025).
- ~ Tipped Employees: Workers earning over $30/month in tips (e.g., restaurant servers) must receive at least $3.63/hour, with tips ensuring total pay meets the minimum wage. Employers must cover any shortfall.
- ~ Overtime: Non-exempt employees earn 1.5 times their regular rate for hours over 40 per week. Exemptions apply for certain industries, like restaurants with less than $400,000 in annual gross income.
- ~ Subminimum Wages: Employees under 18 can earn 85% of the minimum wage ($12.75/hour), those under 20 can earn $4.25/hour for the first 90 days, and full-time students working ≤20 hours/week can earn $10.63/hour.
- ~ Pay Frequency and Notices: Employers must pay at least every two weeks or twice monthly (except for administrative/executive roles). As of October 1, 2024, new hires must receive written notice of pay rate, paydays, and leave benefits. Pay stubs must detail employer information, hours worked (for non-exempt employees), and deductions.

### Pay Transparency

As of October 1, 2024, Maryland employers must include wage ranges, benefits, and compensation details in all job postings for positions performed at least partially in the state. This information must be disclosed before compensation discussions or upon request, with records kept for three years.

Notable Laws:

- ~ Maryland Wage Payment and Collection Law: Ensures timely wage payments and remedies for unpaid wages, including liens on employer property.
- ~ Secure Maryland Wage Act: Requires $16.00/hour for employees at heightened security locations (e.g., BWI Airport) starting January 1, 2025.
- ~ Living Wage Law: State contractors with contracts ≥$100,000 must pay a living wage (e.g., $16.63/hour in Tier 1 counties, $17.60 in Montgomery County).
- ~ Earned Wage Access: Regulates services for accessing earned wages before payday, effective October 1, 2025.
- ~ Effective July 1, 2025, non-compete agreements are banned for healthcare providers earning less than $350,000/year and veterinary practitioners/technicians, with others limited to one year and a 10-mile radius.
- ~ Maryland is an at-will employment state, allowing termination for any non-discriminatory reason without notice, unless a contract specifies otherwise. Protections exist against firing for whistleblowing, workers’ compensation claims, or protected activities like voting or jury duty.

    fullContent: `

## Leave Policies: Maryland offers various leave protections to support employees’ work-life balance:



### Family and Medical Leave:

- ~ Federal FMLA: At companies with 50+ employees, eligible workers get up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for serious health conditions, family care, or childbirth/adoption.
- ~ Maryland Parental Leave Act: Employers with 15–49 employees must provide 6 weeks of unpaid leave for childbirth or adoption.
- ~ Maryland FAMLI Program: Starting July 1, 2025, contributions begin for the Family and Medical Leave Insurance program, with paid leave benefits (up to 12 weeks, or 24 for parental leave) available from July 1, 2026. Employers with 15+ employees contribute 0.90% of wages (split 50-50 with employees), while smaller employers contribute 0.45% (deducted from employees).
- ~ Sick and Safe Leave: The Maryland Healthy Working Families Act mandates paid sick leave for employers with 15+ employees (1 hour accrued per 30 hours worked, up to 40 hours/year); smaller employers provide unpaid leave. Montgomery County has its own stricter sick leave law.

### Other Leaves:

- ~ Military Leave: Up to 15 days of paid leave for National Guard or Maryland Defense Force members.
- ~ Voting Leave: Up to 2 hours of paid leave if employees lack two consecutive off-duty hours during polling hours.

      'Key Maryland employment laws on protections and rights.',
    fullContent: `

## Maryland’s anti-discrimination laws promote fair treatment in the workplace:

### Anti-Discrimination Protections

- ~ Maryland Fair Employment Practices Act (FEPA): Employers with 15+ employees cannot discriminate based on race (including hair texture/hairstyles), color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, age, national origin, marital status, disability, genetic information, or military status (added October 1, 2024). Harassment is considered discrimination.
- ~ Equal Pay for Equal Work: Prohibits wage disparities based on protected characteristics for comparable work. Employees can sue for wage differentials as of October 1, 2024.
- ~ Ban the Box: Employers with 15+ full-time employees cannot ask about criminal history before the first in-person interview, except for roles involving minors or vulnerable populations.
- ~ Job Applicant Fairness Act: Prohibits most employers from requiring credit checks for applicants.

### Workplace Safety

The Maryland Occupational Safety and Health (MOSH) program enforces workplace safety through inspections and consultations. Penalties for violations increased as of July 15, 2025, up to $161,323 for willful/repeated violations. The Healthy Retail Employee Act requires retail employers with 50+ employees to provide a 15-minute break for 4–6 hour shifts and a 30-minute break for shifts over 6 hours. Minors get a 30-minute break every 5 hours.

### Pay Transparency

As of October 1, 2024, Maryland employers must include wage ranges, benefits, and compensation details in all job postings for positions performed at least partially in the state. This information must be disclosed before compensation discussions or upon request, with records kept for three years.

### Whistleblower Protections

Maryland Whistleblower Law: Protects employees who report violations of law, rule, or regulation, or refuse to participate in illegal activities. Employers cannot retaliate against whistleblowers.

    fullContent: `

## Pre-Boarding practices (1–2 Weeks Before Start Date):

### Administrative Setup:

- ~ Collect and verify required paperwork (e.g., W-4, I-9, direct deposit information, state-specific forms). Use digital HR software (e.g., Harri, Altametrics) to streamline document submission.
- ~ Confirm compliance with employment eligibility (e.g., Right to Work verification).
- ~ Set up payroll and benefits accounts, ensuring direct deposit is ready for timely payments.

### Workspace Preparation:

- ~ Prepare workstations (e.g., front desk computers, kitchen tools, spa treatment rooms) and IT access (e.g., POS systems, scheduling software, email accounts).
- ~ Issue uniforms, name tags, or role-specific equipment (e.g., server aprons, spa kits).
- ~ Clean and organize the employee’s workspace (e.g., locker, desk, or station)

### Communications:

Send a welcome email with:

- ~ First-day schedule, reporting details, and dress code.
- ~ Employee handbook (digital or printed).
- ~ Overview of company mission, vision, and values.
- ~ Contact information for HR and their supervisor.

### Pre-Boarding Resources:

Provide access to digital onboarding materials (e.g., online tutorials, menu overview, spa treatment guides) via a Learning Management System (LMS) like Access Hospitality.

- ~ Share a welcome kit (e.g., branded notebook, resort map, or customized backpack).
- ~ Include links to company policies, procedures, and training resources.
- ~ Provide a list local transportation options.
- ~ Share links to company social media pages and community groups (e.g., Facebook, Instagram, Slack channels) to help them connect with colleagues and the company culture.

## Orientation Day 1:

### Welcome and Introductions

- ~ Greet the new hire personally and introduce them to their supervisor, mentor, and key team members (e.g., resort manager, head chef, spa director).
- ~ Conduct a facility tour (e.g., guest rooms, restaurant, spa, event venues, back-of-house areas). Highlight safety exits and key areas.



### Company Culture and Policies:

- ~ Present the organization’s mission, vision, values, and history (e.g., “We create unforgettable guest experiences at our lakeside resort”).
- ~ Review the employee handbook.
- ~ Dress code (e.g., uniforms for servers, professional attire for event staff).

- ~ Benefits (e.g., staff meals, spa discounts, paid time off).
- ~ Safety protocols (e.g., food handling, spa sanitation, emergency procedures).
- ~ Discuss compliance with hospitality regulations (e.g., food safety, alcohol service certifications).



## First Week: Role-Specific Training:

### Job-Specific Training:
- ~ Create a role-specific onboarding schedule (e.g., server training on menu, spa therapist on treatments, event staff on setup protocols). Use templates from Altametrics or Access LMS for consistency.
- ~ Pair the new hire with their mentor for hands-on shadowing (e.g., observing a server during a busy shift or a spa therapist during a massage session).
- ~ Provide digital training resources (e.g., videos on table service, spa hygiene protocols, or venue layout).

### Departmental Introductions:

- ~ Schedule meetings with cross-departmental teams (e.g., servers meet kitchen staff, event staff meet spa team) to understand interdependencies.
- ~ Arrange a brief chat with leadership (e.g., resort general manager or restaurant manager) to emphasize their value.

### Performance Expectations:

- ~ Review the job description and performance metrics (e.g., guest satisfaction scores for servers, treatment bookings for spa staff, event setup accuracy for venue staff).
- ~ Set goals for the first 30 days (e.g., memorize menu, master one spa treatment, execute a small event setup).
